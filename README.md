@nsf-open/ember-utility-library
===================================================

The NSF Utility Library is a collection of packages that provide common utility/helper methods for Ember based 
projects at the National Science Foundation.

A monorepo for such simple-looking packages may seem like overkill, but this also serves as a live testbed for
new tools and techniques.
